Archive-name: gawk/patch1

This is not really a patch, but is rather some notes about packing.

First off, sorry about the problem with the split gawk.texinfo filenames:
if you are on a system that doesn't have long filenames, you will have to
edit the shar fles before unpacking them.  I just fixed my tools to do
something about that.

Second, some people could not easily determine what part in the gawk.texinfo
file had control characters in it.  Here it is:

\catcode `\^^@=\other
\catcode `\^A=\other
	    This should be the character 01, CTRL-A
\catcode `\^B=\other
	    This should be the character 02, CTRL-B
\catcode `\^^C=\other
\catcode `\^^D=\other
\catcode `\^^E=\other
\catcode `\^^F=\other
\catcode `\^^G=\other
\catcode `\^^H=\other
\catcode `\=\other
\catcode `\^^L=\other
\catcode `\^N=\other
	   This should be the character 016, CTRL-N
\catcode `\^O=\other
	   This should be the character 017, CTRL-O
\catcode `\^P=\other
	   This should be the character 020, CTRL-P
\catcode `\^Q=\other
	   This should be the character 021, CTRL-Q
\catcode `\^R=\other
	   This should be the character 022, CTRL-R
\catcode `\^S=\other
	   This should be the character 023, CTRL-S
\catcode `\^T=\other
	   This should be the character 024, CTRL-T
\catcode `\^U=\other
	   This should be the character 025, CTRL-U
\catcode `\^V=\other
	   This should be the character 026, CTRL-V
\catcode `\^W=\other
	   This should be the character 027, CTRL-W
\catcode `\^X=\other
	   This should be the character 030, CTRL-X
\catcode `\^Y=\other
	   This should be the character 031, CTRL-Y
\catcode `\^Z=\other
	   This should be the character 032, CTRL-Z
\catcode `\^^[=\other
\catcode `\^^\=\other
\catcode `\^^]=\other
\catcode `\^^^=\other
\catcode `\^^_=\other
\catcode `\@=\other
\catcode `\^=\other
exit 0 # Just in case...
