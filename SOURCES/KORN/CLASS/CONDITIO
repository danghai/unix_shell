  Conditional Expressions
     A conditional expression is used with the [[  compound  com-
     mand  to  test  attributes  of files and to compare strings.
     Word splitting and file name generation are not performed on
     the  words  between  [[ and ]].  Each expression can be con-
     structed from one or more of the following unary  or  binary
     expressions:

     -a file         True, if file exists.
     -b file         True, if file exists and is a block  special
                    file.
     -c file         True, if file exists and is a character spe-
                    cial file.
     -d file         True, if file exists and is a directory.
     -f file         True, if file  exists  and  is  an  ordinary
                    file.
     -g file         True, if file exists and is has  its  setgid
                    bit set.
     -k file         True, if file exists and is has  its  sticky
                    bit set.
     -n string       True, if length of string is non-zero.
     -o option       True, if option named option is on.
     -p file         True, if file exists and is a  fifo  special
                    file or a pipe.
     -r file         True, if file  exists  and  is  readable  by
                    current process.
     -s file         True, if file exists and  has  size  greater
                    than zero.
     -t fildes       True, if file descriptor  number  fildes  is
                    open and associated with a terminal device.
     -u file         True, if file exists and has its setuid  bit
                    set.
     -w file         True, if file  exists  and  is  writable  by
                    current process.
     -x file         True, if file exists and  is  executable  by
                    current  process.   If  file  exists and is a
                    directory, then the current process has  per-
                    mission to search in the directory.
     -z string       True, if length of string is zero.
     -L file         True, if file exists and is a symbolic link.
     -O file         True, if file exists and  is  owned  by  the
                    effective user id of this process.
     -G file         True, if file exists and its  group  matches
                    the effective group id of this process.
     -S file         True, if file exists and is a socket.
     file1 -nt file2
                    True, if  file1  exists  and  is  newer  than
                    file2.
     file1 -ot file2
                    True, if  file1  exists  and  is  older  than
                    file2.
     file1 -ef file2
                    True, if file1 and file2 exist and  refer  to
                    the same file.
     string = pattern
                    True, if string matches pattern.
     string != pattern
                    True, if string does not match pattern.
     string1 < string2
                    True, if string1 comes before  string2  based
                    on ASCII value of their characters.
     string1 > string2
                    True, if string1 comes after string2 based on
                    ASCII value of their characters.
     exp1 -eq exp2   True, if exp1 is equal to exp2.
     exp1 -ne exp2   True, if exp1 is not equal to exp2.
     exp1 -lt exp2   True, if exp1 is less than exp2.
     exp1 -gt exp2   True, if exp1 is greater than exp2.
     exp1 -le exp2   True, if exp1 is less than or equal to exp2.
     exp1 -ge exp2   True, if exp1 is greater than  or  equal  to
                    exp2.

     In each of the above expressions, if file  is  of  the  form
     /dev/fd/n,  where  n is an integer, then the test is applied
     to the open file whose descriptor number is n.

     A compound expression can be constructed from  these  primi-
     tives  by  using  any of the following, listed in decreasing
     order of precedence.

     (expression)   True, if expression is true.  Used  to  group
                    expressions.
     ! expression   True if expression is false.
     expression1 && expression2
                    True, if expression1 and expression2 are both
                    true.
     expression1 || expression2
                    True, if either expression1 or expression2 is
                    true.
