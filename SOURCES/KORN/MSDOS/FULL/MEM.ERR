MS-Shell Version 2.x: Memory Manager Errors.

Release 2.x generates

    Warning: XMS error (hex number) or
    Warning: EMS error (hex number)

when it detects a XMS or EMS manager error.  The following list gives the
values of the hex number and their meaning.  If the Shell reports one of
these errors, something unexpected has happened.


XMS Errors:

    80		The function is not implemented
    81		A VDISK device is detected
    82		An A20 error occurs
    8E		A general driver error occurs
    8F		An unrecoverable driver error occurs
    90		The HMA does not exist
    91		The HMA is already in use
    92		DX is less than the /HMAMIN= parameter
    93		The HMA is not allocated
    94		The A20 line is still enabled
    A0		All extended memory is allocated
    A1		All available extended memory handles are in use
    A2		The handle is invalid
    A3		The SourceHandle is invalid
    A4		The SourceOffset is invalid
    A5		The DestHandle is invalid
    A6		The DestOffset is invalid
    A7		The Length is invalid
    A8		The move has an invalid overlap
    A9		A parity error occurs
    AA		The block is not locked
    AB		The block is locked
    AC		The block's lock count overflows
    AD		The lock fails
    B0		A smaller UMB is available
    B1		No UMBs are available
    B2		The UMB segment number is invalid

EMS Error Codes:

    80		Internal error in EMM software (possibly corrupted driver)
    81		Hardware malfunction
    82		EMM busy (dropped in EEMS 3.2)
    83		Invalid EMM handle
    84		Function requested not defined - unknown function code in AH.
    85		No more EMM handles availible
    86		Error in save or restore of mapping context
    87		More pages requested than exist
    88		Allocation request specified more logical pages than currently
		availible in system (request does not exceed actual physical
		number of pages, but some are already allocated to other
		handles); no pages allocated
    89		Zero pages; cannot be allocated (dropped in EMS 4.0)
    8A		Logical page requested to be mapped outside range of logical
		pages assigned to handle
    8B		Illegal page number in mapping request (valid numbers are 0 to
		3)
    8C		Page-mapping hardware state save area full
    8D		Save of mapping context failed; save area already contains
		context associated with page handle
    8E		Restore of mapping context failed; save area does not contain
		context for requested handle
    8F		Subfunction parameter not defined (unknown function)
    90		Attribute type undefined
    91		Warm boot data save not implemented
    92		Move overlaps memory
    93		Move/exchange larger than allocated region
    94		Conventional/expanded regions overlap
    95		Logical page offset outside of logical page
    96		Region larger than 1 MB
    97		Exchange source/destination overlap
    98		Source/destination undefined or not supported
    99		(no status assigned)
    9A		Alternate map register sets supported, specified set is not
    9B		All alternate map & DMA register sets allocated
    9C		Alternate map & DMA register sets not supported
    9D		Alternate map register or DMA set not defined, allocated or is
		currently defined set
    9E		Dedicated DMA channels not supported
    9F		Dedicated DMA channels supported; specifed channel is not
    A0		Named handle could not be found
    A1		Handle name already exists
    A2		Move/exchange wraps around 1 MB boundry
    A3		Data structure contains corrupted data
    A4		Access denied
