________________________________________________________________________________

This document provides a set of instructions for modifying the Microsoft C
v5.1 Library function open so that the O_NOINHERIT flag is passed to MSDOS.
The CodeView commands are given where appropriate.

1.  Using CodeView (or a similar debugger), set a breakpoint on the call to
    open in S_open.

    - v S_open
    move cursor to open
    - <F9>

2.  Execute to the break point.  You may have to enter a command which opens
    a file.

    - g

3.  Display the Assembly listing

    - <F3>

4.  Single step the debugger into the open function

    - <F8> (5 times on my system)

5.  Page through the assembler listing until you find the Interrupt 21 call.
    In my version, this is about 16 assembler instructions into the open
    function.  The call sequence is:

    mov		byte ptr [bp - 4], 80H
    push	ds
    lds		dx, dword ptr [bp + 6]
    and		al, 03
    or		al, bh
    mov		ah, 3d
    int		21H

6.  Record the machine code values for this sequence (especially the last 4
    instructions).  On my system these are:

    2403	and		al, 03
    0AC7	or		al, bh
    B43D	mov		ah, 3d
    CD21	int		21H

7.  Exit CodeView

8.  Extract the module open.obj from your library.

    lib llibce "*open.obj;"

9.  Using an appropriate binary editor (or hex dump program) look for the
    sequence of machine code values leading up to the interrupt (see step 6
    above).  In my version of open.obj, it starts at offset 0x0f2 in the
    file.  Change the AND AL, 03 instruction to AND AL, 83 by changing 24
    03 to 24 83.

    You may have to write a little program to open the file in binary mode,
    seek to the appropriate location and write 0x83 to the file and close
    it.

10. Re-load the module in the library (you may want to keep a copy of the
    original module/library in case of problems).

    lib llibce "-+open.obj;"

11. Re-link the shell

12. Check that the AND AL, 03 has become an AND AL, 83 using steps 1 to 5.
