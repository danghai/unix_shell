       Shareware  version of this software and documentation as	you
       wish; give exact	copies of the original Shareware version to
       anyone; and distribute the Shareware version of the software

       means.  There is	no charge for any of the above.

       REGISTERED VERSION

       One registered copy of WinXs may	either be used by a  single
       person  who uses	the software personally	on one or more com-
       puters, or installed on a single	workstation used  nonsimul-
       taneously by multiple people, but not both.

       You may access the registered version  of  WinXs	 through  a
       network,	provided that you have obtained	individual licenses
       for the software	covering all workstations that will  access
       the  software  through the network.  For	instance, if 8 dif-
       ferent workstations will	access WinXs on	the  network,  each
       workstation  must  have its own WinXs license, regardless of
       whether they use	WinXs at different times or concurrently.
