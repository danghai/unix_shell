X
XMere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program (or its
Xderivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
Xthe other program under the scope of these terms.
X
X  3. You may copy and distribute this program (or a portion or derivative
Xof it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
Xof Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

X    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
X    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
X    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
X
X    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
X    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal
X    shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the
