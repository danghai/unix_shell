Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What does "LI" stand for?
A: LI was born as a DOS program, where a short name was an advantage (you
   had to type it in). I didn't think to change its name when it moved to
   Windows. "LI" is short for "list".

Q: Sometimes LI will ask to switch into hex mode only after I've scrolled
   down into a file a ways.
A: This is typically due to the format of the file. If LI finds a line longer
   than 256 characters, it will not display it in normal text mode. The 
   choices will be to wrap every line a 77 characters or view the file in
   hex mode. Read the Technical Info in Help for more details.

Q: Do you plan to view files in their "native" format? e.g. WinWord, Write,
   etc.
A: This is not high on my priority list of future enhancements. There are
   just too many formats and too little of me.

Q: Do you plan to add some file management features, such as copy, move,
   rename.
A: This is higher on my priority list than the "native" viewer stuff, but
   may still be a ways in the future.

Q: The editor should handle bigger files.
A: The built in editor is based upon the same Windows capabilities as NOTEPAD,
   and therefore suffers from the same limits. If I can dream up a method
   of providing this capability without greatly increasing the size of the 
   LI executable file, I'll do it. (Win32 supports this, feature will be
   added.)
