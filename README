September 11, 1996

korn:	Korn-shell scripts from the examples in the book.

csh:	C-shell scripts from the examples in the book.

bourne:	Bourne-shell scripts from the examples in the book.

The following directories under the "sources" directory
contain the following public domain, freeware, and
shareware programs/source code.  Whenever possible, source
code and scripts are provided.  Not all platform were
possible.  Some of the UNIX tools are also provide for
non-UNIX systems such as MSDOS, Windows, NT, Amiga, Macs,
etc.

ash:    Ash is a version of sh with features similar to  those  of
	the  System  V shell.
	ash/linux/ashlinux.tar:  NetBSD's ash (Almquist sh) for Linux.
		This tar file contains the source code for the 93/09/18,
		version 0.2, release of NetBSD Ash shell.  It has been
		ported to Linux platform along with patches to function
		correctly.

awk:    Awk is a programming language that permits easy manipulation
	of structured data and the generation of formatted reports.     
	There are some source script available under the dir_01 and
	dir_02 directory tree.  Under the dir_02/gawk211, is the shell
	archive to compile to provide gawk version 211.  Basic Bourne
	shell is all required to compile.

				  this function which converts date(1) to the
				  Canadian/International format YY/MM/DD.
        awk/dir_01/datetoda.awk:  DateToWeekDay is a standard AWK, (possible
				  mawk extensions), program to compute the
				  weekday given the date.
        awk/dir_01/fromtoda.awk:  FromToday.awk is a standard AWK program which
				  when passed an integer returns the date (and
				  day) in that many days. i.e. On Dec Mon DEC
				  24th "awk -f FromToday 1" would yield "Tue
				  December 25th".
        awk/dir_01/hour2dec.awk:  Hour2Dec is a standard AWK, GNU Copylefted
				  function for converting HH:MM to hours and a
				  decimal minute portion. i.e. It will convert
				  1 hour 30 minutes to 1.5 hours.

	primitive and lacks job control features.  Under the bourne
	directory is series of files that consists of the shell archive
	for compiling bourne shell into a UNIX system.

gawk:   Gawk  is  the GNU Project's implementation of the AWK pro-
	gramming language.  It conforms to the definition  of  the
	language  in  the POSIX 1003.2 Command Language And Utili-
	ties Standard.  This version  in  turn  is  based  on  the
	description  in  The  AWK  Programming  Language,  by Aho,
	Kernighan, and Weinberger, with  the  additional  features

grep:   Grep searches the named input files (or standard input  if
	no files are named, or the file name - is given) for lines
	containing a match to the given pattern.  By default, grep
	prints the matching lines.  There are different favors/version
	of grep: egrep, fgrep, agrep, etc.  Each one tries to solve some
	problem or define a easier way of greping something.

	backward  movement  in the file as well as forward movement.
	Also, less does not have  to  read  the  entire  input  file
	before starting, so with large input files it starts up fas-
	ter than text editors like vi.

	    to distribute code when binary transmission is not possible.
	    Most of the shell archive is readable but must follow
	    instructions, usually included, for the archive to function
	    correctly.
	    shellarc/getether.sh:	find IP addrs for all local ether
					addrs (V1.4).

	    easier transmit them via email system which are usually text
	    based (7-bits bytes) systems.
	    shellscr/shellmen/...	a simple shell-level menu system,
					V3.1.  This is a shell archive.

sort:   Sort sorts,  merges,  or  compares all the lines from the given
	files, or the standard input if no  files  are  given.   A
	file  name  of `-' means standard input.  By default, sort
	writes the results to the standard output.
	sort/macitosh/sort-10.hqx:	Unix like sort tool for the Mac.	

ssh:    In UNIX, creating another shell is not hard it the source code
	is available.  If you do, please carry the authors vitals along
	with your and his/hers permission.  This is only a file 
	description another shell that can be had.
	ssh/ssh-170:	Short description on ssh (Steve's Shell).

			This is a shell archive.

tcsh:   Tcsh is an enhanced version of the Berkeley UNIX  C  shell
	csh(1).   It  behaves exactly like the C shell, except for
	the additional utilities.  More shell archives also available
	in this directory for the tcsh.

	tcsh/tcsh601/...:	Another shell archive for the Tcsh. 

unixtool:    UNIX is not the only platform that can have tools such as:
	     shells (ksh, csh), sed, sort, tr, wc, grep, diff, more,
	     cat.  This directory holds code for  amiga, atari, mac,
	     msdos, win3, and win95.
	     unixtool/amiga/pdksh-bi.lha:	Binary files for the PD(KSH).

Warning:  Some of source code and script are encode for a UNIX based
	  system.  You may be able to view those files but would be
	  unable to execute them in a non-UNIX platform.

	  For the HP-UX systems, dynamic and static are precompiled
	  code where the libraries are linked differently.
